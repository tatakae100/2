HopfieldNetwork Class:
The HopfieldNetwork class represents the Hopfield network.
It has an initializer __init__ which takes the number of neurons (n_neurons) in the network as input and initializes the weights matrix with zeros.
The weights matrix (self.weights) stores the connection weights between neurons.

Training (train method):
The train method takes a set of binary patterns as input and adjusts the weights matrix accordingly.
It iterates over each pattern in the input set.
For each pattern, it computes the outer product of the pattern with itself using np.outer, which gives a matrix representing the connections between neurons.
It then adds this outer product matrix to the weights matrix (self.weights), effectively updating the weights based on the input pattern.
After updating the weights, it fills the diagonal of the weights matrix with zeros to ensure that neurons do not have self-connections.

Prediction (predict method):
The predict method takes a single binary pattern as input and returns the predicted (reconstructed) pattern.
It calculates the energy of the input pattern using the energy function for Hopfield networks: 
−0.5∗pattern∗weights∗pattern.
Then, it computes the dot product of the input pattern with the weights matrix (pattern @ self.weights).
Finally, it adds the energy to the dot product and applies the sign function element-wise to get the predicted pattern.

Patterns and Network Initialization:
The program defines a set of binary patterns (patterns) that the network will be trained on.
It also specifies the number of neurons (n_neurons) in the network.
An instance of the HopfieldNetwork class is created with the specified number of neurons.

Training and Prediction:
The program trains the network with the provided patterns using the train method.
Then, it iterates over each pattern in the input set and predicts the pattern using the predict method.
The input pattern and the predicted pattern are printed for each iteration.

This program demonstrates how a Hopfield network can be trained to store binary patterns and then recall similar patterns when presented with noisy or incomplete input.
